# Point of a Trajectory
# Zero heading corresponds to the positive x direction in the given frame.
# All fields should default to 0.
# As noted in the original message, it is possible that more fields will
# be added overtime (e.g., jerk).
# Note: We use type duration instead of std_msgs/Duration to make the API
# consistent. The only difference is, that 'time_from_start.nsecs' is int32,
# whereas it is uint32 in ROS2.
